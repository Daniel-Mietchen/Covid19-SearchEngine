# Covid19-SearchEngine
Search engine for bibliography related to covid-19 from: 
- COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). 2020. Version 2020-03-13. Retrieved from https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research. Accessed 2020-03-23. doi:10.5281/zenodo.3715506

Part of this code is completely based on the contributions of @dgunning on Kaggle: 
- https://www.kaggle.com/dgunning/browsing-research-papers-with-a-bm25-search-engine 

And also some code from this work was useful: 
- "Building a basic Search Engine using Elasticsearch & fscrawler by InfinitelyInquisitive" https://link.medium.com/K9rMIzFh44

# Description

There are two apps: **"update indexes.py"** is used for generating the search index as a ```.pickle``` file and the rest in ```/app``` folder basically read the ```.pickle``` search index and run a webapp with flask. 

All the requirements on ```requirements.txt``` 

## "update indexes.py"

- **INPUT**: change ```input_dir``` varible in ```line 17``` with the path to the folder with the articles (link to .zip: https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/download)

- **OUTPUT**: ```.pickle``` file with the search index

## "main.py"

- **INPUT**: change ```index_file_name``` varible in ```line 16``` with the name of the ```.pickle``` file generated by **"update indexes.py"**

- **OUTPUT**: ```python main.py``` on your python environment to have the app running

This work was inspired by the need of contribute in this battle against corona virus, I think even the smallest contribution can help solve problems. This webapp is available on http://covid19papers.expdata.xyz you can test it and check the results. I hope you can find this useful
